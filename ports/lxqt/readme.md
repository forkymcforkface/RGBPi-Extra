Make sure you are on the internet
Unzip all files to ports or a folder within ports, and scan for games.
1. Run STEP1_LXQT_install, it can take up to 10 minutes to run. The system will reboot itself when done
2. Run STEP2_LXQT_config, this will configure the desktop
3. Run Desktop.sh to bring up the desktop.
4. You can now delete LXQT_install and LXQT_config if you would like.
5. If you want a browser I would recommend ```sudo apt-get install firefox-esr -y``` It runs much better than chromium out of the box.
